# New++ Super Mario Bros
With Bowser defeated in a final clash, the Mushroom Kingdom breathed easy. But peace was short-lived. Bowser Jr., burning with grief and rage, refused to accept his father's death. The Koopalings, loyal and vengeful, stood beside him. They rallied the remnants of Bowser’s armies, and airships—and launched coordinated assaults across the kingdom. Their mission was clear: defeat Mario, reclaim the throne, and forge a new Koopa empire in Bowser’s name.

In the chaos, Princess Peach receives a letter, addressed to Mario and all of his allys. It reads:

“Meet me at Father’s grave in Fallen Koopa Forest. One final battle. No running. No mercy. You took everything from me—now face me and pay for what you’ve done.”

The final battle awaits, deep in the shadows of the forest, what trials has Bowser Jr prepared?
